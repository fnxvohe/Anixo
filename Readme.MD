## 🌌 Overview

**AniXo** is a high-performance, premium anime streaming platform built for speed, aesthetics, and reliability. It bridges the gap between multiple metadata providers (AniList, MAL, Kitsu) and high-quality streaming sources to deliver a seamless, ad-free watching experience.

Unlike traditional platforms, AniXo features a **Hybrid Resilience Engine**—ensuring the platform remains functional even during major third-party API outages.

## 🏗️ Architectural Blueprint

The system is split into three core layers designed for maximum scalability and zero downtime.

## 📂 Database Schema (MongoDB)

Our data model is designed for high-concurrency and fast lookups:

- **Users:** Stores hashed passwords, profile settings, and account metadata.
- **Watchlist:** Tracks anime status (`Watching`, `Planned`, `Dropped`) and current progress.
- **Comments:** A nested system for episode-specific discussions and community engagement.

---

## 🛠️ Detailed Setup Guide

### 1. Prerequisite Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Key variables to set:
- `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A long random string for auth security.
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address (e.g., `user@gmail.com`).
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Your 16-digit Gmail App Password.
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Your frontend domain (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` or `https://anixo.online`).

### 3. Frontend Installation (Root Directory)

# Run this in the project root to install frontend dependencies
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Backend Proxy & Scraper (Python)

# Install Python dependencies and start the scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api/index.py
```

### 5. Authentication Server (API Directory)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: You MUST also install dependencies in the api folder
cd api
npm install
npm run dev  # Starts the auth gateway on port 5001
```

## 🛡️ Security & Performance
To ensure a premium and safe experience, AniXo implements:
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents API abuse and brute-force attacks via `express-rate-limit`.
- **Security Headers:** Uses `helmet` to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure stateless session management for user data.
- **HLS Optimization:** Adaptive bitrate streaming for smooth playback on any network.
- **Scraper Caching:** Reduces external API calls by caching stream results in `stream_cache.json`.

---

## 📜 Development Scripts
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the Vite development server for the frontend. |
| `npm run build` | Compiles the frontend for production deployment. |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues. |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the production build locally. |

---

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Recommendation AI:** Personalized suggestions based on watch history.
- [ ] **Social Features:** Friend lists and activity feeds.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Developers
- **Environment Security:** Never commit your `.env` file to a public repository. Use the included `.env.example` as a template for other contributors.
- **Scraper Health:** If you notice slow loading times, check the `stream_cache.json` file. It helps reduce redundant API calls but can be cleared if data becomes stale.
- **Rate Limit Management:** When using the Jikan fallback, avoid making more than 3 requests per second to stay within their free-tier limits.
- **HLS Stability:** For the best streaming performance, ensure your server supports `CORS` and use `hls.js` compatible browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari).
- **Vercel Deployment:** If deploying to Vercel, make sure to configure the `vercel.json` properly to handle both Python and Node.js runtimes.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Anime Not Found"** | Check if your Python proxy is running on port 5000. |
| **Login Fails** | Ensure your `MONGO_URI` is correct and IP access is enabled in Atlas. |
| **Video Not Playing** | Try switching servers (S1/S2) or check your internet connection. |
| **Rate Limits** | If Jikan fallback triggers too often, you may hit Jikan's 429 limit. |
